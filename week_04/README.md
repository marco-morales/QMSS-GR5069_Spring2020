## Week 4 - Workshop: Coding Etiquette

A good starting point on coding best practices for social scientists is this old article by Jonathan Nagler (1995) - [__Coding Style and Good Computing Practices__](http://www.jstor.org/stable/420315) - providing  very useful advice on coding as related to ETL and data analysis. Still incredibly relevant advice. If you only have a few minutes ti skim, that  piece was more recently (2015) updated and summarized in a blog post - [__Writing Good Code__](https://blog.oup.com/2015/02/jonathan-nagler-writing-good-code/).

For more advanced hackers, you will benefit from a more systematic approach to improving your coding practices by reading a few more specialized pieces:

* [__The Practice of Programming__](http://www.informit.com/store/practice-of-programming-9780201615869), per Jonathan's recommendation read the Preface, Chapters 1, 3, 5, 6, and the Epilogue
* [__The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs__](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) to better understand object-oriented languages, and
* [__The Pragmatic Programmer__](https://www.amazon.com/dp/020161622X/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=devtools-20) with general advice on how to be a good programmer/coder

### Coding Style in Python

Nothing is more satisfying for a Python devotee than coming across code crafted in the correct "Pythonic" way. Not a hard thing to achieve since the community has produced a comprehensive document that leads the way - [__PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code__](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Be nice to your fellow Pythonistas - and your future self - and learn it by heart.

### Coding Style in R

A lot of knowledge has been accumulated over the last years and systematized in coding style rules by the RStudio folks. For a book-version, you may want to read [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)'s  chapters on [R code](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html) and [Code Style](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html) from his [__R Packages__](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) book. You may also want to go directly to the [`tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org) that contains best practices followed by all developers working on the `tidyverse`. (While the guide itself was originally an evolution from an older [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml), Google has now adopted the [`tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org) too).


### Commenting your git commits

Unless you are a seasoned developer, it may not be obvious why or how to comment a git `commit`. Fortunately, Chris Beams (2014) wrote a very nice post - [__How to Write a Git Commit Message__](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) - that provides much needed guidance and advice on the appropriate way to write `commit` messages.
