This repository is a companion to the course __Applied Data Science for Social Scientists__ taught at the [__Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences__](http://qmss.columbia.edu/) program over the Spring of 2020.

It contains curated reference materials, slides and sample code. You can find the most updated version of the course syllabus [here](/syllabus/GR5069_Spring2020.pdf). Make sure to check regularly for updates.


## Overview

In his now classic [Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), [Drew Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Conway) described **Data Science** as sitting at the intersection between **good hacking skills**, **math and statistics knowledge**, and **substantive expertise**. As a result of normal instruction, social scientists possess a fluid combination of all three but also bring an additional layer to the mix. We have acquired slightly different training, skills and expertise tailored to understand human behavior, and to _explain why things happen the way they do_. __Social scientists are, thus, a particular kind of data scientist__.

This course is a collection of topics that fill very specific gaps identified over the years on what a social scientist should know at minimum when entering data science, and what a data scientist should know to hit the ground running and add immediate value to their teams.

To do that, this course aims to:
* teach processes and practices at the **intersection of Data Science and Data Engineering** that are central to the **data product cycle**. Data Scientists typically start being exposed to Data Engineering on the job. There's much to be gained from early exposure to concepts and practices in this field;

* sharpen you technical skills not only in **fitting models**, but particularly in **building knowledge and generating insights** from the data. While this may seem obvious for a Data Scientist, it is not always the focus of training,

* train in **working effectively in teams** to build projects and products. Data Science is collaborative in nature and constantly evolving in **best practices** that enhance efficient collaboration. Collaboration for school projects/assignments is vastly different from the **highly-structured collaboration** that happens in DS teams, but is not always the focus of training, and

* sharpen and enhance **soft skills** that are key to a successful interaction with business stakeholders. The most important - and often neglected - activity of a data scientist is to obtain expert knowledge from and communicate with non-technical audiences. The greatest insight/project/product is moot if no one outside the Data Science team understands it or its value.

All of these are highly valued skills in the data science job market, but not always considered explicitly as part of an integral Data Science curriculum.

## Prerequisites:

It is assumed that students have basic to intermediate knowledge of object-oriented programming - e.g [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) or [__Python__](https://www.python.org) - including experience using it for data manipulation, visualizations, and model estimation. Some mathematics, statistics and algebra are also assumed.


## Course Resources

There are no required textbooks for this course. Curated readings for each week's topic will be available in __Canvas__. Sample code and other materials will be available in this repo. Starter code for in-class and take-home exercises will be available in the course's __GitHub classroom__ repo. A __Slack__ workspace for this course is also available with multiple channels to facilitate team collaboration within the class.

## To actively participate on this course

Make sure to have the latest versions of [__R__](https://www.r-project.org/)/[__RStudio__](https://www.rstudio.com/), and/or [__Anaconda__](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), as well as [__Git__](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer. Sign up for a [__GitHub__](https://github.com) account if you don't have one already. [__Atom__](https://atom.io/) is  recommended to simplify your interaction with Git and GitHub.

Registered students will receive instructions to get access to __GitHub classroom__, __Google Cloud Platform__, __Databricks__, and __Slack__ resources to be used for this course.
