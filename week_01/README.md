## WEEK 1 - Overview: Data Science & Data Engineering Perspectives


### What is Data Science?

Data Science remains a very nebulous concept with a very fluid definition, perhaps for the best. While there is no agreed upon definition, it is nonetheless important to understand the thinking in the field.

A great starting point is this deeply thought piece by David Donoho (2017) - [__50 Years of Data Science__](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734) - discussing data science (and statistics) and arguing - correctly - that there is more Statistics in Data Science than Data Scientists - who have not been thoroughly trained in Statistics - are prepared to admit. Underlying his argument is _critical thinking about data_ as a core requirement for Data Scientists. An incredibly relevant piece for Social Scientists to read as they head into the world of Data Science.

For a much more applied perspective that complements Donoho's, listen to Hillary Mason's (2018) interview - [__Data Science, Past, Present and Future__](https://soundcloud.com/dataframed/1-data-science-past-present-and-future) - in the [DataFramed podcast](https://soundcloud.com/dataframed), where she provides a very insightful walkthrough of processes, realities, challenges and areas of opportunity for Data Science circa late 2017. The world has changed much since, but her points are still incredibly relevant.

### What is a Data Scientist and what does a Data Scientist do?

It's hard to separate Data Science, the discipline, from the people that perform it. A lot more has been written about Data Scientists and the work they do, seeking to provide more practical grounding to define Data Science.

Leveraging his role as host of the [DataFramed podcast](https://soundcloud.com/dataframed), Hugo Bowne-Anderson (2018) compiled a very nice summary article - [__What Data Scientists Really Do, According to 35 Data Scientists__](https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists) - where he organizes the common topics that emerged from conversations with his 30+ guests, giving us a sense of what Data Scientists do circa 2018. A longer - and funnier - [talk version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSFWw6n0CZs&feature=youtu.be) of this article is also available.

Perhaps the most famous definition from this perspective comes from the title of an article by Thomas Davenport & DJ Patil's (2012) - [__Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century__](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) - where they uncover the then-nascent profession populated by individuals they describe as "a hybrid of data hacker, analyst, communicator, and trusted adviser".

Yet, the urge to understand what Data Scientists do as means to define Data Science started much earlier with a post by Drew Conway (2010) - [__The Data Science Venn Diagram__](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) - where he defines the profession as the intersection of its three core elements: (i) hacking skills, (ii) math & statistics knowledge, and (iii) substantive expertise. Many iterations of this idea have followed, as you can see in David Taylor's (2016) compilation - [__Battle of the Data Science Venn Diagrams__](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/10/battle-data-science-venn-diagrams.html).

Around the same time as Conway, a non-Venn-diagrammed view of Data Science was published in this very early post by Hillary Mason and Chris Wiggins (2010) - [__A taxonomy of Data Science__](http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/) - describing, possibly for the first time in writing, the tasks that in their view should define Data Science at the beginning of the 2010s.

### How is a Data Scientist different from a Data Engineer?

If you have read, seen and listened to the references above, it will be clear that a good number of activities described as belonging to the realm of Data Science can be hard to distinguish from those performed in Data Engineering. But there is, and there should be a difference between both activities, although that is not always true in practice.

Jesse Anderson's (2018) post - [__Data engineers vs. data scientists__](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/data-engineers-vs-data-scientists/) - makes a very crisp argument about the difference between data scientists and data engineering underscoring the limited skills overlap between both roles. His broader point: failing to recognize these differences might allocate people in the wrong roles.

### Critical Thinking in Data Science

In addition to understanding the technical discussions above, you should also know that __one of the most important skills that a Data Scientist must have is critical thinking__, in particular about data and its appropriateness to answer the question at hand. Put more colloquially, the ability to realize that _not all problems are nails to the Data Scientist's favorite hammer._

Debbie Berebichez's (2019) interview - [__Critical Thinking in Data Science__](https://soundcloud.com/dataframed/critical-thinking-in-data-science) - in the [DataFramed podcast](https://soundcloud.com/dataframed) gives a very intuitive and personal perspective on what critical thinking should mean for a Data Scientist. Cassie Kozyrkov's (2019) article - [__The First Thing Great Decision Makers Do__](https://hbr.org/2019/06/the-first-thing-great-decision-makers-do) - adds to the argument by discussing the importance of thoroughly understanding the context of a problem to be able to think critically about how best to solve it, even before you start thinking of the Data Science tools to apply.  


### Current Best Practices in Data Science

We will cover many current best practices in the field throughout the course. But there is one which still stirs passions: __Agile__. Some swear by it, while others swear it's not s good idea for Data Science work.  (Not surprisingly, one of us is a big believer in the Agile way, but the other is a big believer in only implementing Agile-like principles when it makes sense). The jury is still out on __Agile__, but precisely for that reason you should understand what it is and what makes it attractive in the field. A few recommended posts will help you get there.

Start by reading [__The Psychology of Agile__](https://medium.com/agile-in-learning/the-psychology-of-agile-87f92521a5ed) that summarizes the benefits that people perceive from the **Agile** way. Read also [__Stop Brainstorming and Start Sprinting__](https://medium.com/@jakek/stop-brainstorming-and-start-sprinting-16180839b43d) about what a **sprint** is, how it works, and why it's useful, but don't forget to read a complementary perspective in [__From Agile to Fragile: How to unravel your team in one sprint__](https://medium.com/agile-in-learning/from-agile-to-fragile-how-to-unravel-your-team-in-one-sprint-5e60e70a557) on how and where sprints can go wrong. Wrap up with [__MVP Paradox And Hereâ€™s How To Fix Your MVP Before Its Too Late!__](https://hackernoon.com/mvp-paradox-and-what-most-founders-need-to-be-aware-of-3a5f8c3acb76) on how to think about minimum viable products (**MVPs**).
